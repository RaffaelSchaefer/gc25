# AGENTS Instructions

## Code Style

- Use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to format code (`npm run format`).
- Stick to TypeScript and React best practices. Prefer functional components and named exports.
- Keep functions small and focused. Avoid large files when possible.

## Testing & Linting

- Run `npm run lint` and `npm test` before committing changes.
- Fix or document any failing checks.

## Miscellaneous

- Do not commit changes to generated files unless required.
- Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for messages (e.g., `feat:`,
  `fix:`, `docs:`).
